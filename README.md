# Warhammer 40,000 Quiz

### [Live Website](https://emarnus.github.io/Warhammer40kQuiz/)

My Warhammer 40K quiz is meant to be a simple site made using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The objective of the site is to provide a fairly simple quiz for anyone interested. My main goal for the website was to have an easily expandable question pool, I was mostly successful. To achieve this separate json files were used for the different question sets, and comments were left in script.js where code needs to be add for new files. Very easy to add more questions to existing files, just copy the existing format and they will work in game.

  - Featured at the top of the page, the title introduces the subject content, reinforced by the header image.
  - The users name, set by the user and stored using local API.
  - The score system is a simple increment for a correct answer, on clicking check answer.

- __The Game Area__

  - This section is the main focus of the page and where the action happens.
  - The area starts with a haiku and once the game is started the text is replaced with a question and 4 answers.
  - Also contains a counter for the question you are on out of total questions.

- __Adding Factions__
<ol>
  <li>Create a json file in the format of the others, need all key pairs in order.</li>
  <li>Search in script.js for *Add New Faction* and add/update</li>
